# Compiling cubebox in Linux
## Dependencies
You need

`libsdl1.2-dev
freeglut3-dev
libglu1-mesa-dev
libsdl-sound1.2-dev
libsdl-mixer1.2-dev`


(tested with Debian 6.0.4)

## Compiling
cubebox uses Makefiles!
Type
`make client`
to compile and
`make install`
to copy the binary file to _/usr/bin/cubebox_

This should work without any problems, if the dependencies are
all ok. Have fun!
